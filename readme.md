# ninjahex

From the opening, the goal was to create a hexagonal shaped character, thus the name Ninja-Hex, however I soon realized that creating the logic for collision detection for diagonal moving lines (the edges of the player character) would be too much of a hassle for a project 1. Even though the shape has been abandoned, the dream of eventually implementing a feature to trasform the shape into a hexagon (mayhaps in celebration, having achieved a final win condition?) still burns on. One BIG feature to implement as soon as I can is to erase the previous frames upon each directional button press so as to keep a single square onscreen rather than keeping all copies until the canvas is wiped clear


The source of inspiration for this project stems from an internet classic 'Worlds Hardest Game'. Although unsure where to find the original publishing, here is a link referencing the inspiration:

There were very many resources which I combed through in order to find the appropriate functions, such as how to create a canvas in the first place, which I referenced Sololearn's Game Development course, or the YouTube Channel Fireship for web dev tips, JS tips, and general CS. Special thank you to Jordan for assisting in movement logic implementation and to Tylus for helping in cracking resetting the canvas. I came into project week somewhat behind due to missing 12~ hours the week prior (last week at time of typing). During this time is when trello and figma was showcased. I have not utilized Trello whatsoever for this project and will be creating one after reaching mvp right before project due time for aquaintance with the platform. During the very beginning of project week, I prioritized reviewing and creating figma to help me visualize, but when meeting with Jeremy and being told to focus on getting JavaScript down first, I abandoned Trello until now, the end.
